# AFA-PredNet: Action FormulAted Predictive Coding Network 

The PredNet model (\cite{lotter2016deep}) was considered  to be the first model that utilised the PP concept into application, in which the camera video stream during driving can be predicted by the model. However, only the perception (video stream in this case) was considered in the PredNet architecture. On the other hand, the execution of voluntary movements is also another factor while our mind is doing prediction.  Therefore, the proposed  Action FormulAted Predictive Coding Network (AFA-PredNet) model learns the predictive coding rules by constructing the sensormotor contigencies within a layerly representation.
